# Tasks: DropInDrop - WhatsApp E-commerce Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-whatsapp-drops/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US2 (products) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US3 (drops) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 (products) and US4 (authentication)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US5 (orders)
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US5 (tickets)
- **User Story 8 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 (products) and US5 (orders)
- **User Story 9 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 (drops)

### Within Each User Story

- Domain models before services
- Services before API routes
- API routes before UI components
- Core implementation before integration features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within User Story 2: Product and Category entities can be developed in parallel
- Within User Story 3: Drop and WhatsApp Group entities can be developed in parallel
- Within User Story 5: Order and Ticket entities can be developed in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Product Management)

```bash
# Launch all domain models for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create Product entity domain models and types in src/entities/product/domain/product.ts"
Task: "Create Category entity for product organization in src/entities/category/domain/category.ts"

# Launch all repositories for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Implement product repository with CRUD operations in src/entities/product/domain/product-repository.ts"
Task: "Implement category repository in src/entities/category/domain/category-repository.ts"

# Launch all services for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create product service with business logic in src/entities/product/domain/product-service.ts"
Task: "Create category service in src/entities/category/domain/category-service.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Super Admin Setup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Product Management)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Drop Creation)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Client Authentication)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Order Flow)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (if tests included)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
