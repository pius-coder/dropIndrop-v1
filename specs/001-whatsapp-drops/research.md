# Research & Technical Decisions: DropInDrop WhatsApp E-commerce Platform

## Overview

This document captures research findings and technical decisions for implementing the DropInDrop WhatsApp e-commerce platform. All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the technical context have been resolved through research and analysis.

## Decision Log

### 1. WhatsApp Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Use existing WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) implementation from mvp-deprecated

**Rationale**:

- WAHA is already implemented and tested in the existing codebase
- Provides both individual chat and group messaging capabilities
- Supports text, image, and media sending with proper error handling
- Has session management and connection state monitoring built-in
- Simpler integration than official WhatsApp Business API

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Official WhatsApp Business API: More complex setup and rate limiting
- WhatsApp Web scraping: Unreliable and against terms of service

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use existing `WahaChatService` and `WahaGroupService` classes
- Session management already implemented with connection state checking
- Support for text messages, images with captions, and reply functionality
- Error handling with retry logic for failed sends

### 2. Payment Gateway Selection

**Decision**: Stripe Payment Links + Stripe Checkout for web payments

**Rationale**:

- Excellent mobile experience with Apple Pay/Google Pay support
- Built-in support for multiple currencies and payment methods
- Strong webhooks for order status updates
- PCI DSS compliant with secure payment processing
- Good documentation and developer experience

**Alternatives Considered**:

- PayPal: Limited mobile optimization compared to Stripe
- Square: More focused on in-person payments
- Local payment processors: Higher complexity for integration

**Implementation Notes**:

- Payment Links for simple product purchases
- Webhook verification for security
- Automatic retry for failed payments
- Support for payment status tracking

### 3. QR Code Generation and Scanning

**Decision**: Use `qrcode` library for generation and `@zxing/library` for scanning

**Rationale**:

- `qrcode` provides reliable QR code generation with error correction
- `@zxing/library` offers cross-platform barcode scanning capabilities
- Both libraries have excellent TypeScript support
- `@zxing/library` supports various barcode formats beyond QR codes

**Alternatives Considered**:

- `react-qr-code`: React-specific, less flexible for complex use cases
- `jsQR`: Scanner-only library, would need separate generator

**Implementation Notes**:

- QR codes to contain order verification URLs with encrypted order IDs
- Fallback to manual code entry when scanning fails
- Error correction level M for reliable scanning
- SVG format for crisp display at all sizes

### 4. Mobile-First Design Patterns

**Decision**: Implement progressive web app (PWA) with mobile-first responsive design

**Rationale**:

- PWAs provide app-like experience on mobile devices
- Mobile-first approach ensures optimal experience on primary platform
- shadcn/ui components are inherently mobile-friendly
- Service workers enable offline capability for core features

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Native mobile apps: Higher development and maintenance cost
- Responsive-only design: Missing PWA benefits like offline access

**Implementation Notes**:

- Viewport meta tag for proper mobile rendering
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate
- Bottom navigation for mobile interfaces

### 5. Real-Time Features Architecture

**Decision**: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates with WhatsApp webhooks

**Rationale**:

- SSE provides efficient real-time communication without WebSocket complexity
- WhatsApp webhooks enable push notifications for message status
- Simpler implementation than WebSocket for primarily server-to-client updates
- Better browser compatibility than WebSockets

**Alternatives Considered**:

- WebSocket: Overkill for primarily unidirectional updates
- Polling: Inefficient for real-time requirements

**Implementation Notes**:

- SSE endpoints for order status updates
- WhatsApp webhook verification for security
- Connection retry logic for network interruptions
- Proper cleanup of SSE connections

### 6. Authentication Strategy

**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with WhatsApp OTP verification

**Rationale**:

- JWT tokens enable stateless authentication across the platform
- WhatsApp OTP provides secure, user-friendly verification
- Refresh token pattern for session management
- Compatible with existing auth patterns in the codebase

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Session-based auth: Less scalable for mobile applications
- OAuth-only: Overkill for WhatsApp-centric platform

**Implementation Notes**:

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with refresh tokens
- OTP codes valid for 5 minutes only
- Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies
- Rate limiting on OTP requests per phone number

### 7. Calendar Integration for Drops

**Decision**: Custom calendar component using React Big Calendar with drag-and-drop

**Rationale**:

- React Big Calendar provides full calendar functionality with good mobile support
- Drag-and-drop enables intuitive drop scheduling
- Customizable views (month, week, day) for different admin needs
- Good TypeScript support and active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered**:

- FullCalendar: Heavier library with more features than needed
- Custom calendar from scratch: Too time-intensive for development

**Implementation Notes**:

- Month view as default for drop scheduling
- Color coding for different drop statuses
- Click-to-edit functionality for existing drops
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions

## Technical Specifications

### WhatsApp API Limits & Constraints (WAHA)

- **Message Limits**: No strict daily limits (depends on WhatsApp account status)
- **Message Types**: Direct messaging to individuals and groups supported
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with connection state monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Natural WhatsApp rate limiting (avoid spam detection)
- **Media Support**: Images, documents, and other media types supported

### Performance Targets

- **Page Load Time**: <2 seconds for all pages
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for core operations
- **Concurrent Users**: Support for 1,000 simultaneous users
- **WhatsApp Delivery**: 95%+ message delivery rate

### Mobile Optimization

- **First Contentful Paint**: <1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: <2.5 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: <0.1
- **Touch Target Size**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements

## Risk Mitigation

### WhatsApp API Dependency (WAHA)

- **Risk**: WAHA session disconnection or WhatsApp account restrictions
- **Mitigation**: Use existing session management with auto-reconnection, implement retry logic for failed sends, provide manual fallback for critical operations

### Payment Processing

- **Risk**: Payment gateway failures during high-traffic periods
- **Mitigation**: Implement idempotency keys, webhook verification, automatic retry for failed payments, clear error messaging for users

### Mobile Compatibility

- **Risk**: QR code scanning issues across different devices/cameras
- **Mitigation**: Provide manual code entry fallback, test across multiple devices, clear user guidance for scanning

## Next Steps

With all technical clarifications resolved, the project is ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts. The research above provides sufficient detail for:

- Data model design based on entity structure
- API contract definition for all user interactions
- Technology stack validation against requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
